#Job App Tracker
## goal
Goal of this project is to create a program that iterates through a gmail account every 24 hours and updates an excel sheet ( or google sheet) with the status of all job applications submitted. 

##current status
I successfully set up gmail API to connect to an account. Now, I am working on reading messages from gmail and will eventually work on importing those messages onto a sheet.

## future plans
[ ] connect gmail api
[ ] retrieve emails with header, contents, and sender
[ ] research machine learning methods
[ ] implement machine learning with job app emails sorted by human
[ ] set up google sheet with emails and import
[ ] figure out how to run autonomously
